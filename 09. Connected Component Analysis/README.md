# Connected Components Analysis

The code performs a connected components analysis on a graph loaded from a GraphML file using the `networkx` library in Python.

#### Load the Graph

The code imports the `networkx` library as `nx`. The graph is loaded from a GraphML file named "Network.graphml" using the `read_graphml()` function and stored in the `graph` variable.

#### Perform Connected Components Analysis

The `connected_components()` function from `networkx` is used to perform connected components analysis on the graph. It identifies and returns a list of connected components (or subgraphs) in the graph. The list of components is stored in the `components` variable.

#### Save Analysis Results to a Text File

The code specifies the name of the output file as "Connected_Component_Analysis_results.txt". It opens the file in write mode using a `with` statement, ensuring proper handling and closing of the file. The code writes the number of connected components to the file, followed by each component and its corresponding index using a `for` loop.

#### Print Path of Saved File

Finally, the code prints a message to the console, indicating the path where the connected components analysis results are saved. The message includes the name of the output file.
