    "1. The code imports the PRAW library, which is used for interacting with the Reddit API.\n",

    "5. The code loops through each subreddit in the list, and for each subreddit, it collects the usernames of users who have posted in it.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The code then uses a loop to iterate through each subreddit in the list and collect the usernames of users who have posted in the subreddit. It uses the `reddit.subreddit()` function from the PRAW library to get the subreddit object by name. Next, it loops through the top 1000 \"hot\" submissions in the subreddit using the `subreddit.hot()` function and gets the author ofeach submission using the `submission.author` attribute. If the author exists and is not already in the list of usernames, it adds the author's username to the list and prints a message indicating that a username has been collected. The code then prints a message indicating that all usernames have been collected from the current subreddit.\n",
    "\n",
    "- After collecting usernames for all subreddits, the code writes the collected usernames to a file using the `open()` and `write()` functions. It opens a file called \"subreddit_name.txt\" (where \"subreddit_name\" is the name of the subreddit being scraped), and writes each username to a new line in the file. Finally, the code prints a message indicating that all usernames have been collected and saved to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This code  is useful for collecting a list of users who are active in a particular subreddit, which will be used for further analysis.\n"
