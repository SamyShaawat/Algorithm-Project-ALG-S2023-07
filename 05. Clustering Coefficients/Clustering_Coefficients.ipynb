    "The provided code performs the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imports the `networkx` library, which is commonly used for graph analysis and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loads a graph from a GraphML file called \"Network.graphml\" using the `nx.read_graphml()` function and assigns it to the `graph` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculates the clustering coefficient for each node in the graph using the `nx.clustering()` function and assigns the results to the `clustering_coefficients` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Calculates the average clustering coefficient of the graph using the `nx.average_clustering()` function and assigns it to the `avg_clustering_coefficient` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Specifies the name of the output file as \"Clustering_Coefficients_results.txt\" and assigns it to the `output_file` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Opens the output file in write mode using the `open()` function and the `with` statement. This file will store the clustering coefficients and the average clustering coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Iterates over each node in the `clustering_coefficients` dictionary using a `for` loop, where each node and its corresponding clustering coefficient are extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Writes the node label, clustering coefficient, and average clustering coefficient to the output file. Each measure is written on a separate line.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. After the loop ends, closes the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Prints a completion message indicating that the clustering analysis results have been saved to the \"Clustering_Coefficients_results.txt\" file.\n",
