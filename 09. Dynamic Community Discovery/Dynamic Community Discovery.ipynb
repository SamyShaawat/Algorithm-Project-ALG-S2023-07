    "#### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the networkx library for graph analysis, the matplotlib library for plotting, and the label propagation algorithm for community detection.\n",
    "2. Load graph from GraphML file using networkx.read_graphml function.\n",
    "3. Perform community detection using label_propagation_communities function from networkx.algorithms.community module. This function returns a generator of sets of nodes, each set representing a community.\n",
    "4. Create a layout for the graph using spring force model using networkx.spring_layout function. This function returns a dictionary of node positions keyed by node label.\n",
    "5. Plot the graph with communities using matplotlib.pyplot functions. Create a figure with specified size, draw the graph with light gray nodes, assign a unique color to each community, and add a title to the plot.\n",
    "6. Save the plot to an image file using matplotlib.pyplot.savefig function.\n",
    "7. Save communities to a text file using open function and write function. Loop over each community and its index and write the community number and its members to the file."
