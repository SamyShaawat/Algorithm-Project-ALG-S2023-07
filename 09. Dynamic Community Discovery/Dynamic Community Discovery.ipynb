    "#### Dynamic Community Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a program that analyzes a network of nodes and edges and finds groups of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network. These groups are called communities or clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the necessary libraries for graph analysis and plotting.\n",
    "2. Load the graph from a GraphML file that contains the nodes and edges information.\n",
    "3. Perform community detection using the label propagation algorithm, which assigns labels to nodes based on their neighbors' labels until a consensus is reached.\n",
    "4. Create a layout for the graph using the spring force model, which places nodes closer if they are connected by an edge and farther if they are not.\n",
    "5. Create a figure with a specified size and assign a unique color to each community using a list of colors.\n",
    "6. Draw the nodes of each community with their corresponding color and save the figure to a png file with a specified format and dpi.\n",
    "7. Save the communities and their members to a text file by writing the community number and its members in each line.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of this program is a png file that shows the graph with different colors for each community, and a text file that lists the communities and their members"
