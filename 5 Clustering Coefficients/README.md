# Clustering Coefficients
## Explanation of the Code

The provided code performs the following tasks:

1. Imports the `networkx` library, which is commonly used for graph analysis and manipulation.

2. Loads a graph from a GraphML file called "Network.graphml" using the `nx.read_graphml()` function and assigns it to the `graph` variable.

3. Calculates the clustering coefficient for each node in the graph using the `nx.clustering()` function and assigns the results to the `clustering_coefficients` variable.

4. Calculates the average clustering coefficient of the graph using the `nx.average_clustering()` function and assigns it to the `avg_clustering_coefficient` variable.

5. Specifies the name of the output file as "Clustering_Coefficients_results.txt" and assigns it to the `output_file` variable.

6. Opens the output file in write mode using the `open()` function and the `with` statement. This file will store the clustering coefficients and the average clustering coefficient.

7. Iterates over each node in the `clustering_coefficients` dictionary using a `for` loop, where each node and its corresponding clustering coefficient are extracted.

8. Writes the node label, clustering coefficient, and average clustering coefficient to the output file. Each measure is written on a separate line.

9. After the loop ends, closes the file.

10. Prints a completion message indicating that the clustering analysis results have been saved to the "Clustering_Coefficients_results.txt" file.

The code calculates the clustering coefficients for each node in a graph and the average clustering coefficient of the graph itself. It then saves these results to a text file for further analysis and interpretation.
