# Network Analysis of Reddit for Egyptians

This repo contains a network/graph analysis of Reddit users who follow Egyptian subreddits. The goal is to understand the structure and dynamics of the Egyptian Reddit community and to identify the most influential and active users and subreddits.

## Dataset

The dataset consists of 23185 rows and 16 columns. The first column contains the usernames of 23185 Reddit users who follow at least one Egyptian subreddit. The other 15 columns contain the names of the subreddits that each user follows. There are 105 Egyptian subreddits in total.

The dataset was collected by scraping Reddit using the PRAW library.

## Network

The network was constructed from the dataset as follows:

- Nodes: Usernames
- Edges: common Subreddit(s) between two usernames

The network was visualized and analyzed using NetworkX and Graphml.

## The Analysis

The following analyses were performed on the network:

- Degree analysis: to measure the number of edges connected to each node and the average degree of the graph.
- Degree distribution analysis: to examine the frequency distribution of the number of edges per node and compare it with theoretical models such as Poisson, power-law, and exponential.
- Path analysis: to measure the average shortest path length and diameter of the network and compare them with random graphs.
- Centrality analysis: to rank the nodes according to their importance or influence in the network using metrics such as degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.
- Connected components analysis: to identify the largest connected component and the number of isolated nodes in the network and calculate their fractions of the total nodes.
- Clustering coefficients: to measure the tendency of nodes to form clusters or triangles in the network and compare them with random graphs.
- Density analysis: to measure the ratio of actual edges to possible edges in the network and compare it with random graphs.
- Network type: to classify the network as scale-free, small-world, random, or regular based on its properties such as degree distribution, clustering coefficient, average path length, and diameter.
- Community discovery: to detect groups of nodes that are more densely connected to each other than to the rest of the network using algorithms such as Louvain method, Girvan-Newman method, and Label Propagation method and evaluate their quality using modularity and silhouette scores.
- Dynamic community discovery: to track how communities evolve over time using dynamic network analysis techniques such as temporal snapshots, sliding windows, and event detection.

I hope this helps. ðŸ˜Š

## .gitignore

- This repo contains a .gitignore file that specifies the files and folders that Git should ignore. The main file that is ignored is Network.graphml, which is a large XML file that contains the network structure. This file represents the network as a graph with nodes and edges, where each node corresponds to a username and each edge corresponds to a common subreddit between two usernames. The edge data also contains the list of subreddits that the two usernames follow.
- This file exist in every folder in the repo because it Network.graphml used in every analysis and can not upload it with the repo because it is very big file
