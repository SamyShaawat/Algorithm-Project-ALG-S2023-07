# Density Analysis

This Python code analyzes the density of a graph using the NetworkX library. It performs the following steps:

1. Import the necessary library - NetworkX.
2. Load the graph from a GraphML file.
3. Get the number of nodes and edges in the graph.
4. Calculate the density of the graph.
5. Write the number of nodes, number of edges, and density to a text file.

The density of a graph is the ratio of the number of edges in the graph to the maximum number of edges possible in a graph with the same number of nodes. The density is a measure of how "dense" the graph is with edges. A graph with a high density has many edges, while a graph with a low density has few edges.

The code calculates the density of the graph using the `nx.density()` function from the NetworkX library. The function takes a graph as input and returns the density of the graph.

After calculating the density of the graph, the code writes the number of nodes, number of edges, and density to a text file called "Density_Analysis_results.txt". This file will contain three lines: one for the number of nodes, one for the number of edges, and one for the density.

Writing the results to a file is important for documenting the analysis and for later reference.
