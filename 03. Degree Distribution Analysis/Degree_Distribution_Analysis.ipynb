    "1. Import the necessary libraries - NetworkX, Matplotlib, and NumPy.\n",

    "3. Calculate the degree of each node in the graph.\n",

    "- The degree distribution of a graph is a probability distribution that describes the number of nodes with a given degree.   \n",
    "- A histogram is a graphical representation of the degree distribution, where the x-axis represents the degree and the y-axis represents the number of nodes with that degree.   \n",
    "- A bar plot is a more common way to visualize the degree distribution, where the y-axis represents the fraction of nodes with a given degree instead of the number of nodes."
