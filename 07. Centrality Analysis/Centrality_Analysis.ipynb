    "#### Centrality Analysis\n",
    "The provided code performs the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Imports the `networkx` library, which is commonly used for graph analysis and manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Loads a graph from a GraphML file called \"Network.graphml\" using the `nx.read_graphml()` function and assigns it to the `graph` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Calculates four types of centrality measures for the nodes in the graph:\n",
    "   - Degree centrality, which quantifies the number of connections each node has.\n",
    "   - Betweenness centrality, which measures how often a node appears on the shortest path between other nodes.\n",
    "   - Closeness centrality, which measures how quickly a node can reach other nodes in the graph.\n",
    "   - Eigenvector centrality, which captures a node's influence based on its connections to other influential nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Opens a file named \"Centrality_Analysis_results.txt\" in write mode using the `open()` function and the `with` statement. This file will store the centrality measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Iterates over each node in the graph using a `for` loop and the `graph.nodes` attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Writes the node label, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality of each node to the file. Each measure is written on a separate line.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Adds a separator line to visually distinguish the centrality measures of different nodes in the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. After the loop ends, closes the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Prints a completion message indicating that the centrality analysis results have been saved to the \"Centrality_Analysis_results.txt\" file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code provides a way to calculate various centrality measures for the nodes in a graph and save the results to a text file for further analysis and interpretation.\n"
