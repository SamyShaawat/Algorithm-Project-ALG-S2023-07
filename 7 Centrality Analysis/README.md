# Centrality Analysis
## Explanation of the Code

The provided code performs the following tasks:

1. Imports the `networkx` library, which is commonly used for graph analysis and manipulation.

2. Loads a graph from a GraphML file called "Network.graphml" using the `nx.read_graphml()` function and assigns it to the `graph` variable.

3. Calculates four types of centrality measures for the nodes in the graph:
   - Degree centrality, which quantifies the number of connections each node has.
   - Betweenness centrality, which measures how often a node appears on the shortest path between other nodes.
   - Closeness centrality, which measures how quickly a node can reach other nodes in the graph.
   - Eigenvector centrality, which captures a node's influence based on its connections to other influential nodes.

4. Opens a file named "Centrality_Analysis_results.txt" in write mode using the `open()` function and the `with` statement. This file will store the centrality measures.

5. Iterates over each node in the graph using a `for` loop and the `graph.nodes` attribute.

6. Writes the node label, degree centrality, betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality of each node to the file. Each measure is written on a separate line.

7. Adds a separator line to visually distinguish the centrality measures of different nodes in the file.

8. After the loop ends, closes the file.

9. Prints a completion message indicating that the centrality analysis results have been saved to the "Centrality_Analysis_results.txt" file.

The code provides a way to calculate various centrality measures for the nodes in a graph and save the results to a text file for further analysis and interpretation.
