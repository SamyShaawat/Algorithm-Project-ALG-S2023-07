# Degree Distribution Analysis

This Python code analyzes the degree distribution of a graph using the NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries. It performs the following steps:

1. Import the necessary libraries - NetworkX, Matplotlib, and NumPy.
2. Load the graph from a GraphML file.
3. Calculate the degree of each node in the graph.
4. Write the degree of each node to a text file.
5. Calculate the degree distribution of the graph.
6. Write the degree distribution to a text file.
7. Create a histogram of the degree distribution.
8. Create a bar plot of the degree distribution using Matplotlib.
9. Set the x-axis limits, title, x-axis label, and y-axis label of the bar plot.
10. Save the plot as a PNG image file.
11. Display the plot in the output cell.

The degree of a node in a graph is the number of edges connected to that node.   
The degree distribution of a graph is a probability distribution that describes the number of nodes with a given degree.   
A histogram is a graphical representation of the degree distribution, where the x-axis represents the degree and the y-axis represents the number of nodes with that degree.   
A bar plot is a more common way to visualize the degree distribution, where the y-axis represents the fraction of nodes with a given degree instead of the number of nodes.
